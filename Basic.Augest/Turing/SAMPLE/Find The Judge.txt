In a town there are N people labelled from  to N.

There is a rumor that one of those pepople is secretly the town Judge.


if the town judge exists
* The town Judge trusts no body
* Everybody (excepts the town judge) trusts the town judge
* there is exactly one person that satisfy property 1 and 2.


You are given trust, an array of pairs trust[i]=[a,b] representing that  the person labelled a trusts the person labelled b.

if the town judge exists and can't be identified return the labelled of the town judge.Otherwise return -1.

Example : 1
input N=2, trust[[1,2]]
output : 2

Example 2
input N=3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]] //  3
								 // 1 3, 2 3
Example 3
input N=3, trust =[[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]
output : -1
