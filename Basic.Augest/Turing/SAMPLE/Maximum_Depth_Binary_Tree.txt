Given a binary Tree find the Maximum Depth.

The Maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down
to the furthest node.

NOTE : a leaf is a node with no children

Example: 

Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]

  3
 / \
9  20
  / \
 15  7

 return it's depth = 3
